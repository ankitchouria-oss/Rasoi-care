# ---------------------------------------------------------------- rate limiting
# Three tiers, each with its own configurable thresholds (env vars below, all
# with sane defaults so nothing needs to be set to run locally):
#
#   AUTH          — login/signup: the routes a brute-force script actually
#                   targets. Combines a per-account AND a per-IP check so
#                   neither "guess one account's password from many IPs" nor
#                   "spray many accounts from one IP" dodges the limit. Uses
#                   exponential backoff (each wrong attempt doubles the wait
#                   before the next one is even accepted) rather than a hard
#                   lockout — a real account owner who mistypes their
#                   password a couple of times is barely slowed down, but a
#                   scripted guesser hits a wait that grows towards
#                   unusable within a handful of attempts. A correct
#                   attempt resets the count immediately, so it's never a
#                   lasting lockout tied to a fixed clock window.
#   PUBLIC        — read-only, unauthenticated informational endpoints
#                   (legal docs, catalog, health check). Moderate: enough
#                   headroom that a real client never notices, still a
#                   real ceiling against scraping/spam.
#   AUTHENTICATED — everything gated behind an existing require_*_auth
#                   decorator (a real signed-in customer/technician/staff
#                   member acting on their own account). Loosest of the
#                   three, and keyed per-account rather than per-IP — a
#                   request that already proved who it is shouldn't compete
#                   for one shared limit with everyone else behind the same
#                   office Wi-Fi/mobile-carrier NAT.
#
# In-memory — no extra dependency (Flask-Limiter) or shared store (Redis)
# needed: this deploys as a single gunicorn worker (see Procfile/render.yaml,
# no --workers flag), so one process's memory *is* the whole app's state.
# Won't survive a restart and wouldn't be enough on a multi-worker/
# multi-instance deploy, but is a real, meaningful brake on a scripted
# brute-force or spam attempt against the current deployment.
