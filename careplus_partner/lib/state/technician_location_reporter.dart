// Starts/stops periodic GPS reporting to Firestore for the Customer app's
// live tracking screen — see technician_location_service.dart for the write
// itself and its Firestore document contract.
//
// This listens to [jobsFeedTickProvider] (bumped by the UI after every real
// fetch/action against [repositoryProvider] completes — see providers.dart)
// rather than being driven directly by screens, so on-duty toggles, job
// acceptance, and job-status advances all naturally trigger a re-check no
// matter which screen performed them. Nothing needs to call this directly;
// a screen just needs to `ref.watch` it once, while mounted, to keep it
// alive for as long as the technician is in the jobs flow (see
// tech_jobs_screen.dart, whose route is never disposed while job
// detail/close are pushed on top of it).
